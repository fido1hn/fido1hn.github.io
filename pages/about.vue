        Hi, I'm Confidence Ekeanya, Senior Web Developer from the city of Lagos.
        With over 7 years of experience in platforms and technologies, including
        Vue, Tailwind, GSAP, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node, Express, Supabase,
        MongoDB, Postgres, LangChain, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion is rooted in tackling complex challenges and crafting
        innovative web solutions that not only solve real-world problems but are
        also built with scalability and ease of maintenance in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that great products not only deliver immediate results but
        also stand the test of time.
