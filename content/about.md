# Hello There, I'm Confidence

## About me

I'm Confidence, I'm a web developer. I'm 27, living in Lagos Nigeria. JavaScript Ninja

A little about me, I started my web development journey in 2017 using WordPress and Shopify. Two years later I started programming in python with a focus on web development, and then gracefully moved on to more JavaScript and these days Typescript. I'm a full stack developer with a passion for building web applications.

I enjoy working with Vue/Nuxt and Supabase for a quick prototype, and NestJS, Node/Bun, PostgreSQL/MongoDB for backend.

## What software/hardware do I use?

Here's a list of everyday used software and hardware:

- Lenovo Yoga 13 ThinkPad
- Fedora Linux Desktop
- VSCode
- Chrome/Firefox Dev
- Git/Github
- Docker
